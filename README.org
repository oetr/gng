An implementation of [[http://web.cs.swarthmore.edu/~meeden/DevelopmentalRobotics/fritzke95.pdf][growing neural gas]] (pdf) in [[http://racket-lang.org/][Racket]].
Growing neural gas is used for reducing the size of a dataset by clustering it.
It starts with a network of two units.
While it is run through the whole dataset, the units are slowly moving towards the data points.
With time the network gets bigger, since new units are regularly added to the network.


Several parameters are used to configure the network:
- epsilon_b --- movement fraction for the nearest unit.
- epsilon_n --- movement fraction for the neighbors of the nearest unit.
- age_{max} --- maximum age of an edge. An edge is removed if it exceeds age_{max}.
- /global-error-decrease/ --- the error of each unit is decreased by this amount after every step.
- /unit-insertion-interval/ --- a new unit is inserted after this amount of steps.
- alpha --- upon insertion of a new unit, the error of the nearest unit and its neighbor is decreased by this amount.
- n-max --- maximum number of units in the network.
